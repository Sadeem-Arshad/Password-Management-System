# Password-Management-System
🔐 Looking back at our Semester 1 triumph: Password Management System built in C++!
Collaborating with my talented teammates Yousaf Iqbal and Hannan Khan, we crafted this secure console application from scratch using C++ with libraries <iostream>, <fstream>, <string>, <cmath>, <cstdlib>, and <ctime>.

𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞’𝐬 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐭 𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬:

𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐫 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐟𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭: Create, view, update, or delete profiles with email, password, phone number, and CNIC, validated and stored in all_Profiles.txt using <fstream>.

𝐏𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐝 𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲: Generates strong or custom passwords with <cstdlib> and <ctime>, encrypts/decrypts them using a Caesar cipher, and analyzes strength and cracking time with <cmath>.

𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐇𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠: Exports/imports profile data to/from Users_Data.csv, handling double quotes in passwords with <string> for robust CSV formatting.

𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬: Requires a 4-digit security key for sensitive actions like deletion or export, and validates inputs (Gmail/Outlook emails, 11-digit phone, 13-digit CNIC).

𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐫-𝐅𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐲 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐞: Provides a console-based menu with <iostream> for seamless navigation and feedback.

This project was a fantastic journey into secure data management and C++ programming.
Grateful for the collaboration with Yousaf and Hannan in bringing it to life! 🚀
